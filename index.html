        <p>
          It's been about two months since I first arrived at Princeton: two months
          since I stood at the edge of the window in my room, crying silently to 
          Taylor Swift's iconic "22" being blasted from First Courtyard, all while 
          trying to get a last glimpse of my family as they drove away. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In what proved to be the busiest, scariest, and happiest two months of my life,
          I gradually began to let go of some of the caution, worry, and doubt that I unconsciously
          brought with me. I may have changed a bit along the way, but those changes were small and felt alright; 
          I tried to spend more time outside; I tried to smile more often; I gave more hugs.
          Princeton, once a distant dream, had somehow become my reality, and I began to 
          feel less uneasy about that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As Fall Break approached, I gave very little thought to the prospect of going 
          home. Midterms played a part, but the other part was just a sense of
          prolonged distance from the life I'd had when I'd been at home. Princeton didn't 
          quite feel like "home" to me (yet?), but at the same time, I felt like a vastly different 
          person from the girl who called that red-brick house "home". Midterms went by
          surprisingly quickly, though, and sooner than I realized, I was back in the very car
          that I'd watched drive away two months ago.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Being home has been interesting. Knowing that I'll be leaving in a week, I try not to
          get too used to it, but I also try to take in and appreciate every moment while
          I'm here. Sometimes, a certain angle of the light or a specific smell tosses
          back memories I didn't realize I'd left behind, and for a brief moment I'll let them 
          creep into the present. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Sometimes, I'll even catch them in a photo.</p>
